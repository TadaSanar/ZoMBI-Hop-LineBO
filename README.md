Line-BO repository: https://github.com/TadaSanar/Line-BO 

Start a ZoMBI-Hop-LineBO run: Run zombihop-line.py

Current implementation: The Line-BO functions are fetched from bo_gpy_dyes.py. This file will be deleted in the future. In the final version, the Line-BO functions will be fetched from linebo_main.py (BO-related functions and the high-level BO loop), linebo_fun.py (Actual Line-BO functions), linebo_plots.py (plotting Line-BO).
